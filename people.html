					<p>Connor is a Senior majoring in Computer Science. For his thesis he is looking at better ways to store geospatial-temporal massive data to expand the types of interactions and increase the feasibility of exploring massive data. In the past he has worked on software visualization, protein visualization, and an information visualization tool to help graphic designers. His interest in massive data focuses on designing new back-end design strategies to help power interaction and usability research. On a broader scale Connor hopes to find ways to promote further collaboration between interaction and visual designers with developers.</p>
