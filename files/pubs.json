  "abstract":     "Visual analytics is inherently a collaboration between human and computer. However, in current visual analytics systems, the computer has limited means of knowing about its users and their analysis processes. While existing research has shown that a user’s interactions with a system reflect a large amount of the user’s reasoning process, there has been limited advancement in developing automated, real-time techniques that mine interactions to learn about the user. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can accurately predict a user’s task performance and infer some user personality traits by using machine learning techniques to analyze interaction data. Specifically, we conduct an experiment in which participants perform a visual search task, and apply well-known machine learning algorithms to three encodings of the users’ interaction data. We achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62% and 83% accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task. Beyond predicting performance, we demonstrate that using the same techniques, we can infer aspects of the user’s personality factors, including locus of control, extraversion, and neuroticism. Further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95% of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time. Overall, our findings show that interactions can provide information to the computer about its human collaborator, and establish a foundation for realizing mixed- initiative visual analytics systems.",
  "summary":     "Visual analytics requires cooperation between human and computer, but while computers can communicate vast amounts of information through their screens and speakers, humans communicate back with limited means, generally just a keyboard and mouse.  Those interactions are rich with information about the user, though.  Researchers have even been able to extract reasoning processes from interaction logs, but only with long tedious hours.  This project is all about automatically finding patterns in interaction data using machine learning.  In our TVCG 2014 paper, Finding Waldo: Learning About Users from their Interactions, we run an experiment to gather mouse interactions while participants play Where's Waldo, a visual search task.  We then produce three types of encodings of the interactions, encompassing (1) what part of the (image) data is shown to the user, (2) statistics about their raw mouse events, and (3) sequences of button clicks.  We apply machine learning and find that we can predict user performance at the Waldo task, and even infer some personality traits from this data.",
