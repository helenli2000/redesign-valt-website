Making Website Changes
----------

Your changes won't show up on the actual website immediately. 

Send an email to Lane if you need something updated immediately. Otherwise, he will be updating the site on /r/valt with the contents of this repo weekly.

Where did my experiment directories go?!
----------

The directory at /r/valt/public\_html contained a lot of random experiment directories. To keep things more organized, we are moving existing studies and future experiments to /r/valt/public\_html/studies.
