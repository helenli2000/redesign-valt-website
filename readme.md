VALT-website
==========

This repo is for our website at [valt.cs.tufts.edu](http://valt.cs.tufts.edu).

There are three components that require regular updates from the team: publications, news, and people.

Adding Publications

To add a publication, edit `files/pubs.json`, and add a 128x64px preview image to `img/preview/`. As an example, see [this recent addition](https://github.com/TuftsVALT/valt-website/commit/a107b8ba916f5a23174e0e4017bbe5421426503f) from Alvitta.

Adding People
---

To add a person, edit `files/people.json` and add a 200x200px headshot to `img/people`.

Adding News
---

To add a news item, edit `files/updates.json` and add a 200x200px related image to `img/news`.

After You Make Changes

Your changes won't show up on the Tufts-hosted website immediately. Send an email to Lane when the content needs to be pushed to the server.
