      Dates: June 17-20, 2016<br>
      Location: 1819 Fairmount Blvd, Eugene, OR<br>

    <h2>Logistics</h2>
    <a name="logistics"></a>
    <div style="padding-left: 45px;">
     
      <b>Flights:</b> The Eugene airport (EUG) is a small airport with direct
      flights from Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, and Denver on
      Delta or United. Flying into Portland is lot cheaper (depending
      on where you're coming from, it can be as much as 200+ dollars),
      but it means that you need to take a shuttle to Eugene, which is
      about a 2 hour ride.  There is a shuttle for $60 one-way or $112
      round-trip (<a
       href="http://www.hutshuttle.com/">http://www.hutshuttle.com/</a>)
      that leaves every 2 hours.  Another option is to share a rental
      car. This means that some coordination will be necessary. We are
      happy to help facilitate this if people are interested. <br>
      
      <div style="color:#F89938"> To faciliate ride-shares, pickups from the Eugene airport or shuttle stop, please send Kristi (<a
      href="mailto:kpotter@uoregon.edu">kpotter@uoregon.edu</a>) your
      flight information.
      </div><br>

      <b>Food:</b> We are still working on food logistics, however there are
      a number of restaurants within walking distance to the
      house, as well as a great beer and food scene in Eugene. We will
      send out emails to coordinate food as the date gets closer.
      <div style="color:#F89938">
	Please send Kristi (<a
	href="mailto:kpotter@uoregon.edu">kpotter@uoregon.edu</a>) any
	dietary restrictions to assist in planning. </div><br>      
    
	<b>Rooming Situation:</b> There are 10 rooms at this house,
	but there are 11 (maybe 12) people. This means that some
	people will need to double-up. If you absolutely cannot have a
	roommate, or conversely would love to have a roommate to help
	cut cost (or have
	a preference to who your roomate would be), please let us know!!<br> <br>

	<b>Cost:</b> The total cost (excluding travel and food) will depend on
	the number of people and roomate situations. The cost of the rental is $2,613.75 ($2,250 + $150 cleaning fee + $213.75 tax). If that's divided by 11 people, the per person cost is $237.61. Divided by 12 is $217.81. Note that depending on the rooming situation, we will likely need to adjust this a bit so that a person with a King-size bed and a private bathroom will be asked to pay a little more.
